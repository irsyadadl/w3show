# w3show
A collection of great portfolio ideas for developers and designers to get inspired when creating their own. Want to add your portfolio or someone else's? Feel free to open a PR to contribute. Inspired by Clone Wars, 30 web developer ideas, and my personal experiences.

## Submit your site

Interesting to submit your site?
Simply add new `mdx` file into `content/portfolio` directory.

But you can make it automatically with run bash script `new.sh` to generate new mdx file with example `frontmatter` for your site.

```shell
1. chmod +x new.sh
2. ./new.sh
```

### Suggestion

Do you know a portfolio you'd like to see added but can't submit yourself? Mention it in this [issue](https://github.com/yuxxeun/w3show/issues), and the community will take care of it. You can also open a PR to add any suggested portfolios.

### Sponsor
As you build your portfolio, we hope it helps you land that job or achieve your goals. If you find this project useful, please give it a star. If you'd like to support it further, consider buying me a coffee. I'd appreciate every cup. â˜•
