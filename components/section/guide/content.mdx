# Get started
To get started with add your site, you can start with two way: 

  - Manually
  - Automatically

## Manually
Create file with `.mdx` format inside `content/portfolio/` directory, with following front matter format:

```mdx
---
author: Your Name
twitter: your_twitter_account
site: https://your_site
stack: [Tech 1, Tech 2, Tech 3, Etc]
repo: https://your_repository_url
image: /portfolio/your_image.png
---
```

For image, you can put inside `public/portfolio/` directory with the size `16:9` for create best picture.

## Automatically
If you prefer a more automated process, you can use the script to quickly set things up!

First, give the script executable permissions by running:

```shell
chmod +x portfolio.sh
```

Next, run the script:

```shell
./portfolio.sh
```

The script will guide you through an **interactive prompt** where you can easily fill in with your details.

## Pull request
After all done, you can open pull request W3Show repository.
