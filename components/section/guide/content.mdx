# Welcome to My MDX Page!

## About This Page
This page demonstrates how to use **MDX** (Markdown with embedded JSX) to combine the power of Markdown for formatting with React components. MDX allows you to write content in Markdown syntax and also render interactive React components, making it ideal for dynamic documentation, blogs, and educational content.

### Key Features:
- **Bold** text: Emphasize certain parts of your text with bold.
- _Italic_ text: Use italics for subtle emphasis.
- `Inline code`: Highlight a piece of code inline with the rest of the content.
- [Links](https://example.com): Create links to external resources.
- Code blocks: Include code snippets with syntax highlighting.
- **React Components**: Embed React components directly into the page.
- Blockquotes: Use blockquotes for highlighting important information or quotes.

## Code Example
Below is a sample **React** code written in JSX, displayed using a code block for clarity:

```jsx
import React from "react";

// A simple functional component that takes a 'name' prop
const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return <h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>;
};

// Exporting the component so it can be used elsewhere
export default Greeting;
```
